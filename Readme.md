Static Method:

Belongs to the class rather than any specific object.
Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
Cannot access non-static (instance) variables or methods directly because it does not operate on an instance of the class.
Non-static Method:

Belongs to a specific instance of a class.
Requires an object of the class to be invoked.
Can access both static and non-static members of the class.
